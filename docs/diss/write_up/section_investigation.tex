\section{Investigation Method}
As alluded to above the most useful metrics which currently exist to analyse parallel programs revolve around 
the program's span also know as it's \emph{critical path}. The critical path is the shortest route through a program. 
The critical path answers the question "Presuming program P is exectuted on an infite number of processors, 
what is the shortest possible time it could take?". In this research the task graph will be analysed at run time 
and the critical path established. This will produce a \emph{critical duration} which is the shortest possible execution time of a program regardless of the number of processors it is run on.

The critical path algorithm devised in this research can be broken into two parts. Firstly the work first aspect, whereby object dependencies are ignored and secondly the
