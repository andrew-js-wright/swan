when each task is ready to execute (arg_issue):

     calculate parent's duration
     calculate parent's work done [p.wd + duration]
     calculate parent's critical path [p.cp + duration]     

     assign task's work done = parent's work done
     assign task's critcial path = parent's critical path

     if task has in/inout dependee objects:
     	set task's critcal path = max critical path of dependee objects

when each task is finished executing (arg_release):

     calculate task's duration
     calculate task's work done [t.wd + duration]
     calculate task's critical duration: 
     	       t.cd = t.cd + duration
	       MAX(t.child_critical_duration, t.cd)
     
     calculate parent's critical duration:
     	       if the task has been spawned:
	       	  p.cd += t.cd
	       else break
     calculate parent's child critical duration:
     	       p.ccd = MAX(p.ccd, t.critical_duration)

     set parent's work done to task's work done

     if task has has out/inout object dependees:
     	       set object's critical duration [MAX(obj.cd, task.cd)]
