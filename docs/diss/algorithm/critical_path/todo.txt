* replace if(parent.critical_duration < task.critical_duration) 
  	  parent.critical_duration = task.critical_duration
  functions with the MAX function to reduce performance impact
* put the algorithm's implementations under compiler flag if statements
* look into moving parent critical path calculation into the task end functor
  under the if(!spawned) statement.
* could regulate the way work done and critical path are being transfered
  between parent and task to improve readability.
